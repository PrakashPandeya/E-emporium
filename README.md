# E-emporium
This is a college project (an e-commerce tech website) and contains a lot of bugs as it was rushed in a very limited time. Made with very basic java backend integrated with mySQL and HTML, CSS and JS in frontend.

To run this, you will need eclipse IDE with tomcat server v8.5. First you need to run the SQL file in a mySQL to create the database Then you need to import the JAR files from Required JAR folder into the Project and remove the old JAR files Then in the StringUtils.java file, you need to change the IMAGE_PATH to the resource folder path Finally, run any servlet and it redirects you to login, register a user and login To access admin panel, you need to go to the database and change the user's role to "admin".
